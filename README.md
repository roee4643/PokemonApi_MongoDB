# PokemonApi_MongoDB
The Pokémon Generator is a Python-based application that interacts with the Pokémon API to retrieve and display random Pokémon details. The application generates random Pokémon names, retrieves their detailed attributes (such as height and weight), and checks if the Pokémon data already exists in a MongoDB database
